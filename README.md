# GesSraper
A guessing Game &amp; a Web Scraper at the same time !

The script scrapes a website that authorizes scraping for quotes and their respective author's information. Once these information on hand, it stores them in a local csv file.
The user on the other hand has to guess the autho's name of a random quote that he is prompted. After each wrong answer, the user is given a hint.

Enjoy !
